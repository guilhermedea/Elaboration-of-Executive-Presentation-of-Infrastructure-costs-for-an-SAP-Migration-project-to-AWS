In this project based on a real-world scenario, I acted as a Cloud Architect and created an executive presentation of infrastructure costs for a SAP 
migration project from On-Premises to AWS.

SAP workloads were running in a corporate DataCenter with the environment divided into Production, Quality Assurance â€” QA, and Development/Test layers.

My mission was to estimate the costs of migration to AWS, considering that this infrastructure will be running on AWS for at least the next 3 years.

I used AWS Pricing Calculator, a very handy tool available through Amazon to estimate costs. The system returned me a price estimate with 3-year discounts. 
Alongside a lesser cost when compared to the traditional physical structures, the cloud model gives greater discounts for long-term plans. And support, 
which is the priciest item on the list, brings much more security with its 15-minute resolution for critical structures. This way, along saving money, the
client that makes the migration to the cloud has the security and the safeness of good support during emergencies.
